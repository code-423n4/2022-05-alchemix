# ‚ú® So you want to sponsor a contest

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our contest collaboration.

Your contest will use two repos: 
- **a _contest_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your contest and for providing information to contestants (wardens)
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted. 

Ultimately, when we launch the contest, this contest repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for contest participants. The findings repo will be made public after the contest is over and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the contest sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Contest prep

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Contest prep
- [ ] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [ ] Modify the bottom of this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing. ([Here's a well-constructed example.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-06-gro/blob/main/README.md))
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**

# Contest Scope
This contest is open for two weeks to give wardens time to understand the protocol properly. Submissions can only be made in the second week of the contest. Representatives from gro will be available in the Code Arena Discord to answer any questions during the contest period. The focus for the contest is to try and find any logic errors or ways to drain funds from the protocol in a way that is advantageous for an attacker at the expense of users with funds invested in the protocol. Wardens should assume that governance variables are set sensibly (unless they can find a way to change the value of a governance variable, and not counting social engineering approaches for this).

## Protocol Overview
Alchemix Finance is a future-yield-backed synthetic asset platform and community DAO. The platform gives you advances on your yield farming via a synthetic token that represents a fungible claim on any underlying collateral in the Alchemix protocol. The DAO will focus on funding projects that will help the Alchemix ecosystem grow, as well as the greater Ethereum community.

- ALCX, the protocol governance token used to incentivize pool liquidity for synthetic assets
- gALCX, an autocompounding wrapper for the single-sided farm that can be used in governance
- alUSD, a synthetic stablecoin pegged to $1 issued to users as an advance on their future yield
- alETH, a synthetic token pegged to 1 ETH issued to users as an advance on their future yield

## Smart Contracts

All the contracts in this section are to be reviewed. Any contracts not in this list are to be ignored for this contest. A further breakdown of contracts and their dependencies can be found [here]().

### Tokens 

#### AlchemicTokenV2.sol (228 loc)
The synthetic token minted by the protocol as an advance on user's yield.
#### CrossChainCanonicalAlchemicTokenV2.sol (22 loc)
An upgradeable version that is compatible with crosschain bridges.
#### gALCX.sol (110 loc)
An autocompounding wrapper for ALCX that is the crosschain native token.
#### CrossChainCanonicalGALCX.sol (19 loc)
An upgradeable version that is compatible with crosschain bridges.

### Core Protocol
#### AlchemistV2.sol (1752 loc)
The AlchemistV2 is the core contract in any Alchemix debt-system that holds Account data and issues that system's debt tokens. The AlchemistV2 is flexible enough to accept deposits in the form of either yield-bearing-assets or underlying collateral assets (and wrapping said underlying tokens into their yield-bearing form).

An Account in the Alchemist has multiple components. The first 2 data-points to understand are **balances** and **debt**.
**Balances** is a mapping of yieldTokens to the Account's respective balance of Alchemist-shares. **Shares** represent a user's deposit of yieldTokens in the AlchemistV2, and provide an accounting abstraction that helps the AlchemistV2 avoid bank-run scenarios.
**Debt** is an int256 type that represents both the account's **debt** (positive values) and **credit** (negative values).
A Account manages its debt by tracking the **lastAccruedWeights** of the various **depositedTokens** that it is holding.
A Account also has the ability to track **mintAllowances** and **withdrawAllowances** that allow 3rd-party accounts to mint and withdraw its assets.
#### TransmuterBuffer.sol (571 loc)
An interface contract to buffer funds between the Alchemist and the Transmuter.

#### TransmuterV2.sol (575 loc)
The TransmuterV2 is the main contract in any Alchemix debt-system that helps put upward pressure on the price of the debt-token relative to its collateral asset(s) by allowing any market participant to exchange the supported debt-token for underlying collateral at a 1:1 rate.
Each TransmuterV2 supports a single underlyingToken as collateral, and is able to exchange debtToken for only that underlyingToken.
The TransmuterV2 recieves underlyingTokens from the AlchemistV2 whenever any of the repay(), liquidate(), or harvest() functions are called. The repaid, liquidated, or harvested collateral is first sent to the TransmuterBuffer, where excess funds that are not exchanged in the TransmuterV2 can be deposited back into the AlchemistV2 to boost yields for Alchemist depositors, or be deployed elsewhere to help maintain the peg.
When debtTokens are deposited into the TransmuterV2, a user recieves "exchanged tokens" into their account over time, representing the amount of debtToken that has been implicitly converted to underlyingToken that have dripped into the TransmuterV2. This rate of conversion is, at most, the rate that collateral is exchanged into the TransmuterV2 multiplied by their overall percent stake of debtTokens in the TransmuterV2. While collateral recieved from harvest() calls has a relatively stable rate, collateral recieved from repay() and liquidate() functions are entirely user dependent, causing the overall transmutation rate to potentially fluctuate.
Additionally, there is a configurable flow rate in the TransmuterBuffer that can be used to control the flow of transmutable collateral. It acts as another cap on the speed at which funds are exchanged into the TransmuterV2.

### Core Protocol Vault Adapters
#### YearnTokenAdapter.sol (58 loc)
An adapter to invest user tokens into Yearn.
#### FuseTokenAdapterV1.sol (109 loc)
An adapter to invest user tokens into Fuse.
#### WstETHAdapterV1.sol (148 loc)
An adapter to invest user tokens into Lido's wstETH.
#### RETHAdapterV1.sol (103 loc)
An adapter to invest user tokens into Rocket Pool's rETH.
#### VesperAdapterV1.sol (107 loc)
An adapter to invest user tokens into Vesper.

### Automated Market Operator
#### TransmuterConduit.sol (43 loc)
A helper contract for admins to move funds between TransmuterV1 and TransmuterV2 during the protocol upgrade.
#### EthAssetManager.sol (724 loc)
An automated market operator to ensure peg stability on alETH and ETH.
#### ThreePoolAssetManager.sol (1040 loc)
An automated market operator to ensure peg stability on alUSD and stablecoins.

### Staking Rewards
#### StakingPools.sol (441 loc)
A staking contract to give ALCX rewards to various LP and single-sided stakers.

### Helper Contracts
#### WETHGateway.sol (96 loc)
Turns ETH into WETH and deposits into the Alchemist.
#### AutoleverageCurveFactoryethpool.sol (49 loc)
Lets users zap into a leveraged collateralized debt position on alETH.
#### AutoleverageCurveMetapool.sol (34 loc)
Lets users zap into a leveraged collateralized debt position on alUSD.
#### Whitelist.sol (63 loc)

## Potential protocol concerns

## Areas of focus for Wardens

We would like wardens to focus on any core functional logic, boundary case errors or similar issues which could be utilized by an attacker to take funds away from clients who have funds deposited in the protocol. We would also encourage focus on any mathematical accounting that could cause users to receive more or less credit than they should. That said, any errors may be submitted by wardens for review and potential reward as per the normal issue impact prioritization. Gas optimizations are welcome but not the main focus of this contest and thus at most 10% of the contest reward will be allocated to gas optimizations. For gas optimizations the most important flows are client deposit and withdrawal flows.

If wardens are unclear on which areas to look at or which areas are important please feel free to ask in the contest Discord channel.

## Tests

A full suite of unit tests is provided for the repo. As Alchemix is in the process of migrating from Hardhat to Foundry, some slight configuration tweaks may be needed to run the suite.

## Mainnet deployment

A working instance of Alchemix v2 has been deployed on Ethereum mainnet in a beta launch, with deposit caps on all vaults. Mint functionality Mint functionality is open for all synthetics, and users are welcome to use and play around with the protocol. But if you want to do do an extensive amount of interactions with the protocol, we would kindly ask you to do so on a fork. All issues should be reported privately via code4rena rather than demonstrated on mainnet to maintain eligibility.
