Hey wardens! We've spun up a specialized discord server where each team can have a private channel to talk with us at Alchemix. Can't wait to see you there! https://discord.gg/Y8BYWKN2sU

"Submissions can only be made in the second week of the contest"
Does it mean if I found something, I should wait 7 days to submit it?

[05/05/2022 11:48 AM] fufanuu
alchemix repo is missing all the hardhat configs/etc needed to run tests on the repo, it's just solidity contracts, is this intended?


[05/05/2022 1:12 PM] foobar#0001
This wording is outdated, it's been corrected & you can submit any time!

🙏 thankyou 

[05/05/2022 5:53 PM] foobar#0001
The repo has been updated with configs and instructions for running the test suite. Enjoy! https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix#running-tests

@foobar@thetechnocratic  is yieldToken is the one alchemix team create using standard ERC20 contract?
While underlyingToken is the one that user may wrap into yieldToken?


[05/05/2022 6:23 PM] foobar#0001
Both underlyingToken and yieldToken are external ERC20s. For example, if a user deposits DAI into an Alchemix vault, DAI is the underlyingToken, yvDAI (yearn vault DAI) is the yieldToken whose contract is controlled by Yearn, and alUSD is the synthetic token issued by Alchemix.

Where did the contracts go?
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-05-alchemix/tree/main/contracts

was in the middle of auditing them


[05/05/2022 6:56 PM] foobar#0001
Folder is `contracts-full`. Structure won't change again

[05/09/2022 7:34 PM] 0xdjango
Can you please explain this quote from your docs to me? Since users can deposit ETH as collateral, can't their debt go up?

"There will never be a liquidation of a user's collateral unless they do it themselves because your debt will only ever go down. Shortly after launch, more stablecoins will be added as collateral in order to borrow alUSD."


[05/09/2022 8:05 PM] foobar#0001
Collateral and debt are always like-kind. So you deposit ETH and take an alETH loan. This means ETH/USD fluctuations don't affect your health factor


[05/09/2022 8:09 PM] 0xdjango
Ah cool, thanks!


[05/09/2022 8:49 PM] 0xdjango
Also in the docs “Whitelist.sol (63 loc)

A whitelist used for the beta stage of protocol release, restricts access to all EOAs and certain whitelisted contracts.”

Do you have plans on removing the whitelist functionality after beta?


[05/09/2022 9:53 PM] thetechnocratic
yes, eventually we would like to disable the whitelists entirely. though we want to be sure the protocol is as secure and resistant to exploits as possible, bc removing the whitelists invites any and all code to plugin to the system. (this contest can be thought fo as a step towards removing the whitelists)

LMAO L134-L135 😂 :
```jsx
File: WstETHAdapterV1.sol
133:         uint256 received = IStableSwap2Pool(curvePool).exchange(
134:             int128(uint128(stEthPoolIndex)), // Why are we here, just to suffer?
135:             int128(uint128(ethPoolIndex)),   //                       (╥﹏╥)
